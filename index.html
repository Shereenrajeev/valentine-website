<h2>🌸 Our Love Story 🌸</h2>

<p>
It all began on June 9, in the most unexpected place — church.  
No big conversations, no dramatic introduction. Just stolen glances.  
Our eyes met once… twice… three or four times — enough for my heart to quietly notice him before my mind did.
</p>

<div class="gallery">

<p>
And as if fate didn’t want to wait, he texted me the very same day.  
I remember smiling so much.  
He asked me out the next day, and I said yes — nervous, excited, curious.
</p>

<div class="gallery">

<p>
Our first date was simple but filled with that unspoken tension.  
He surprised me with a cute Harry Potter sipper, and somehow that small gift made everything feel warmer, sweeter… more real.
</p>

<p>
On June 19, we went on a long drive — windows down, conversations flowing, comfort settling in.  
By then, I felt safe with him. Like I could just be me.
</p>

<div class="gallery">

<p>
The next day, June 20, he dropped me home — just a 10-minute drive from Shell to my place.  
But those 10 minutes weren’t enough.  
For the first time, I missed him… while he was still right there.
</p>

<p>
Then came July 3 — the turning point.  
A house party. I was tipsy, barely present — but he was fully there.  
Holding me, watching me, taking care of me like I was something precious.
</p>

<p>
I don’t remember everything from that day…  
but I remember how safe and loved I felt.  
That was the day my heart quietly said, “Oh… I’m falling.”
</p>

<p>
We spoke every day.  
No labels. No pressure. Just us.
</p>

<p>
On July 11, we went on a cute dinner date with friends.  
I sat facing him and the moon, not knowing that moment would become a memory I’d want to keep forever.
</p>

</div>

<p>
And then there was that tiny, beautiful thing —  
I’m not a girl who keeps flowers in her hair…  
but when he said he loved it, I did it just for him, sent him pictures, and felt strangely shy and happy all at once 🌼
</p>

<p>
July 15, a casual food outing turned into a conversation about labels.  
We both smiled and said, “No terms… let’s go with the flow.”  
But our hearts already knew more than our words.
</p>

<p>
On July 17, I went to his home.  
Movies, food, laughter, hugs, kisses — the soft kind of happiness.  
That day, a thought stayed with me:  
I think I’m in love.
</p>

<p>
And then I found out — he’s liked me since 2019.  
Some stories really do wait.
</p>

<p>
After a short break, we met again on August 18 & 23 at a marriage function.  
And then came August 25 — a date that changed everything.
</p>

<p>
I gathered all my courage and asked him — indirectly, shyly — about us.  
He was tipsy, smiled, and said,  
“We’ll talk, baby… but I love you so much.”
</p>

<p>
He made my birthday extra special with white flowers and thoughtful gifts 🤍  
And on August 29, we went for a candlelight dinner, finally talking about love — quietly, honestly, beautifully.
</p>

<p>
September 7 brought a long drive and a beach date, where we spoke about exclusivity — how hearts need clarity, not confusion.
</p>

<p>
Then September 9, at his home, between kisses and laughter,  
he said the words first:
</p>

<p><strong>“I love you ❤️”</strong></p>

<p>
And I said it back — heart racing, eyes shining.
</p>

<p>
From Mahabalipuram double dates, to cute drives, to long talks about the future —  
we kept choosing each other.
</p>

<p>
Now, here we are.  
A little obsessed.  
Deeply in love.  
And dreaming of a forever together.
</p>
