  <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️</h1>
  <h2>Our Cute Love Story</h2>

  <div class="story">
🌸 Our Love Story 🌸
It all began on June 9, in the most unexpected place church.
No big conversations. Just stolen glances.
Our eyes met once… twice… three or four times enough for my heart to quietly notice him before my mind did.
And as if fate didn’t want to wait, he texted me the very same day. (I was in his blocklist😛)
I remember smiling so much.
He asked me out the next day, and I said yes 🥰nervous, excited, curious.

June10-Our first date was simple but filled with that unspoken tension. But it was so cute😍

On June 19, we went on a long drive windows down, conversations flowing, comfort settling in.
By then, I felt safe with him. Like I could just be me.

The next day, June 20, he dropped me home just a 10-minute drive from chromepet Shell to my place.
But those 10 minutes weren’t enough.
For the first time, I missed him so much

Then came July 3 - the turning point.
A house party. I was tipsy, barely present but he was fully there.
Holding me, watching me, taking care of me like I was his baby
I don’t remember everything from that day…
but I remember how safe and loved I felt.
That was the day my heart quietly said, “Oh… I’m falling.”

We spoke every day.
No labels. No pressure. Just us.

On July 11, we went on a cute dinner date with friends.
I sat facing him and the moon, not knowing that moment would become a memory I’d want to keep forever.

And then there was that tiny, beautiful thing 
I’m not a girl who keeps flowers in her hair…
but when he said he loved it, I did it just for him, sent him pictures, and felt strangely shy and happy all at once 🌼 

July 15, a casual food outing turned into a conversation about labels.
We both smiled and said, “No terms… let’s go with the flow.”
But our hearts already knew more than our words.

On July 17, I went to his home.
Movies, food, laughter, hugs, kisses the soft kind of happiness.
That day, a thought stayed with me:
I think I’m in love.


And then came August 25 — a date that changed everything.
I gathered all my courage and asked him indirectly, shyly about us. (If you really love me I can speak to my dad)
He was tipsy, smiled, and said,
“We’ll talk, baby… but I love you so much.”

And on August 29, we went for a candlelight dinner, finally talking about love quietly, honestly, beautifully.

September 7 brought a long drive and a beach date, where we spoke about exclusivity how hearts need clarity, not confusion.

Then September 9, at his home, between kisses and laughter,
he said the words first

“I love you ❤️”

And I said it back heart racing, eyes shining.
ps: I love him more😛❤️

On September 15, he came all the way to my office for lunch, right after an interview love finding its way even into busy days.


From  dates, to cute drives in November, to long talks about the future 
we kept choosing each other.

Now, here we are.
A little obsessed.
Deeply in love.
And dreaming of a forever together.
